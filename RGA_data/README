We used the files here, /cache/clas12/rg-a/production/recon/fall2018/torus-1/pass1/v0/dst/train/skim4/, of which an updated (but still compatible with our analysis) skim that you should use now would be /cache/clas12/rg-a//production/recon/fall2018/torus-1/pass1/v1/dst/train/nSidis/.

Do these DST files include your analysis selection cuts (The cuts listed in the RGA analysis note) yet?

Just curious what is the "n" in "nSIDIS" for?

The modern “nSIDIS” skim has e- in FD, Q2 > 1, W > 2, p_e > 2, -25 < v_z < 20, c.f.

So not all of our cuts yet (xF, etc.).

Curious what is the "n" in "nSIDIS" for?
Yeah, uh, I’ve never really thought about it too much. I think it was meant to signify any number of particles… I’m not really sure.
